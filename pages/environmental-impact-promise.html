      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        Much of my photography is based on my love of nature and the great outdoors. As such, it's a mission of mine to
        do everything I can to mitigate any negative impact my print shop might have on the environment. From the
        materials used, to the shipping supplies, I'm making a promise to choose sustainable options that minimize our
        environmental footprint.
      </p>
      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        This promise will always be a work in progress, and as I learn more about how to improve the sustainability of
        my work, I will update this page accordingly.

      <h2 class="m-0">Print materials</h2>
      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        All prints are produced in Vancouver, Canada, and printed on premium quality, sustainably sourced, archival
        paper. The paper is sourced from responsibly managed forests, and is certified by the Forest Stewardship Council
        (FSC). This ensures that the paper used is not contributing to deforestation, and that the forests are managed
        in a way that preserves biodiversity and benefits local communities.
      </p>

      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        In addition to being sustainably sourced, the paper is also 100% recyclable and biodegradable. This means that
        if the print is ever discarded, it will not contribute to landfill waste.

      <h2 class="m-0">Shipping supplies</h2>
      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        I only use plastic-free shipping supplies, including cardboard mailers, paper tape, and biodegradable protective
        sleeves. I also reuse shipping materials whenever possible, to reduce waste.
      </p>

      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        As my shop grows, I'm committed to continually improving my shipping process, and will be exploring additional
        sustainable packaging options.

      <h2 class="m-0">Carbon emissions</h2>
      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        Shipping products worldwide inevitably creates carbon emissions. To mitigate this, I plan to offset a portion of
        my shipping-related emissions by donating a percentage of profits to environmental organizations focused on
        carbon reduction and climate action.
      </p>

      <p class="m-0 mt-4 mb-4">
        This commitment will evolve as I refine the shop and better understand its overall footprint.
